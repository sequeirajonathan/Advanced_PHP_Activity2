Use the simple MVC framework implemented on the previous block to create a site with two pages: “employees” and “person”. Create a Model having an array of employees, each employee should have [id, name, age and salary]. The page “employees” should display a header and an HTML list with the employees’ names, each one with a link to see more. This list must come from the Model, it cannot be hardcoded on the Controller, and the HTML elements cannot be created on the Controller either, they must be part of the View. Once a link is pressed, it should send the employee ID to the page “person”, having all the information for that specific employee. Add a menu that is displayed on every page. You can use Bootstrap to make your HTML nicer and faster. Check the progress of students while doing this exercise and help the ones stocked.
