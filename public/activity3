Create a new PhalconPHP project. In the Index Controller add two actions: “home” and “contact”. The page “home” should have a header and some lorem ipsum paragraphs. The page “contact” should have a form asking for name, email and message. Once the form is submitted, the information should be sent to an action named “contactSubmit”, and then displayed to the user letting him/her know that the submission was received. Do not echo any HTML text from the Controllers. You can use Bootstrap to make your HTML nicer and faster.
