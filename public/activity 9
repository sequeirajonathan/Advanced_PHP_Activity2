Make the Index action to receive a CSV on the URL, as well as the option selected (I.E.: domain.com?list=hello,cruel,world&select=world) and using the PHP function explode() convert them to an array and pass them to the view. Loop the array using a Volt template, add all elements into an HTML table with 100% width and paint even rows in a different background color (zebra style). Then highlight in yellow the element selected. If no values were passed, display an error message. Create a new action "help" explaining how to use the site and add a layout to preserve the same styles and the menu on both pages. Feel free to use Bootstrap to improve turnaround times.
